# karma-jasmine-starter
-----------------------
To run as CI mode w/ browsers:
```
npm install
npm test
```
To auto-watch & run PhantomJS only:
```
npm install
npm run test-dev
```

Files in `test/` folder must end with `Spec.js` to be ran. (Can change this in [karma.conf.js](https://github.com/Kottans/karma-jasmine-starter/blob/master/karma.conf.js#L14))
